🚀 Started writing software around **2000**  

👴🏼 I made webs with html, javascript and css that looked good on Internet Explorer when people still used tables to layout sites. 

💥 I made interactive, mind-blowing apps with Flash and ActionScript back in the day that I'm still proud of.    

🕹 I even made isometric and 3D games.  

📈 I made lots of data-driven apps with Flex/C# as a full-stack developer for many kinds of businesses.  

💁🏼‍♂️ I made some python/django sites and apps for small companies and individuals. 

👨🏻‍💻 I've been a .NET developer for quite a long time.  

📱 I started creating mobile apps around 8 years ago.  

🌎 I coded for big tech companies, governments, advertising, media, banks, neobanks, startups, artists, family and friends.   

🏠 I coded for myself for fun and automated the boring stuff.    

👎🏼 I cofounded 3 failed startups. No regrets.  

👨‍👩‍👦 I made a child. No regrets so far. 

🦸🏻‍♂️ I've been a freelance dev for many years.  

🤑 I now find myself comfortable working for a company that pays my bills. 

✍️ I always wanted to maintain a blog, but never found the time for it. Priorities...  

Still in the learning path (it's not a topic, it is what it is).   
Software is a hype ↔ deprecation loop 🔂. Skills will prevail, frameworks and toolkits won't. But at the end of the road, those ups and downs make our dev jobs interesting.
