I love open source and the community that supports it. I could not have gotten where I am now without it. This blog is an attempt to return the favor.
  
Mostly interested in mobile development with Xamarin and REST services with .NET apis. I also enjoy python, UI design/usability and making things look and move smoothly. 

Posts about iOS/Android will probably be based on Xamarin.
