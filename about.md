I love open source and the community that supports it. I wouldn´t have gone far without it. This blog is an attempt to return the favor.
  
Mostly interested in mobile development and REST services/apis with .NET, but I´ve got a love story with python/django as well. 
I´m also a bit of a design & usability fanatic. 

You can find me on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1850606/xleon), [GitHub](https://github.com/xleon/), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegoponcedeleon/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/diegoxleon).

I do freelance work and have experience collaborating with teams remotely. If you want to hire me, drop me an [email](mailto:malandro@gmailcom) or add me to [skype](skype:diegoxleon?userinfo).

> Posts about iOS/Android will probably be based on Xamarin.
